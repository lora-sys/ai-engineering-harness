## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-12

The skill family release. This repo now ships more than one skill.

### Added
- **`skills/build-agent-app/`** — companion skill "Build Agent App". The Agent App Architect: design / take over / refactor an agent app. Writes Agent Contract + Harness Contract, picks an entry workflow (new | takeover | refactor), then hands implementation back to `$ai-engineering-harness`. Triggers on `$build-agent-app`.
- **`scripts/validate-meta.sh`** — extended to walk the entire skill family. With no file argument, it validates `./meta.json` and every `skills/*/meta.json` it finds. `OK: ./meta.json passes schema validation` becomes `Summary: 2 passed, 0 failed`.
- **`meta.json`** at repo root: still the primary entry pointing to `ai-engineering-harness`. Now tags include `skill-family:ai-engineering-harness` and `sibling-skill:build-agent-app` so indexers that don't recurse can still discover the family.
- **`skills/build-agent-app/meta.json`** — the sibling's own metadata. Passes our own `validate-meta.sh --strict` and the upstream skill-creator `quick_validate.py`.
- **`install.sh`** — refactored from single-skill to multi-skill via the `SKILL_SOURCES` map. New flag `--skill <name>` chooses `ai-engineering-harness`, `build-agent-app`, or `all` (default). Maintains full back-compat with the old `--all` / `--target X` / `--uninstall` / `--fat-install` behaviour.
- **`README.md`** — new "Companion skills" section. Documents the family, when to trigger which skill, and a `when-to-call-which-skill` table.

### Changed
- **Skill status: single skill → skill family.** `npx skills add lora-sys/ai-engineering-harness` still installs only the primary skill at canonical (unchanged). The sibling rides along only when using our `bash install.sh` (with `--skill all`, the default).
- **Validation contract.** Both meta.json files now pass `scripts/validate-meta.sh --strict` with 0 warnings. Run as part of release pre-flight.

### Why v1.0.0 (not v0.2.0)
The repository evolved from "one skill prototype" to "a vetted skill family with hand-off contracts". That's a major version-bump-worthy transition. The skill description / install behaviour of `ai-engineering-harness` itself is unchanged, so existing `npx skills add` users see no disruption.

### Install / Update

```bash
# Existing: still works, no behavior change
npx -y skills update lora-sys/ai-engineering-harness -g

# New: install the family (both skills at 38 CLI agent dirs)
bash install.sh --all                        # both
bash install.sh --skill build-agent-app      # only sibling
bash install.sh --fat-install               # git clone + symlink, both skills
```

```

### Compatibility

- No behavior change for `npx skills add lora-sys/ai-engineering-harness -g --all` users.
- The new sibling is opt-in via `bash install.sh --skill build-agent-app`.
- All previous per-CLI-agent routing descriptions remain valid.


## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **`meta.json`** at the repo root — structured metadata for skill indexes (skills.sh and friends). Fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `category`, `priority`, `tags`, plus an `install` map covering the four install shapes (global / specific-skill / specific-agent / both). Schema compatible with the existing skills.sh convention used in `git-copilot/skills/`.
- **Explicit `--all` safety contract** added to the README in both Chinese and English, placed right after the one-line install section. Documents today's safety (1 skill in repo) and the future risk (sister skills install automatically), and gives four safer alternatives:
  - `npx -y skills add lora-sys/ai-engineering-harness --list` (preview)
  - `-s <skill-name>` (limit to one skill)
  - `-a <agents...>` (limit to specific agents)
  - both flags together (one skill × one agent)
- README now links to `meta.json` so anyone curious about the install contract has one place to look.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **`memory/notes-2026-07-11.md`** — a project memory file capturing 6 key decisions from this build cycle, each with Context / Decision / Why / Consequence / **Revisit when**:
  - **D-001** Single-skill repo vs multi-skill (chose single)
  - **D-002** `npx skills` unified `~/.agents/skills/` model (preferred over custom `install.sh`)
  - **D-003** `npx skills add --all` is safe in a single-skill repo (today); revisit when adding a sibling
  - **D-004** SVG for diagrams, PNG only at OG / social-card gateways
  - **D-005** skills.sh is auto-crawled from GitHub — optimize repo metadata, no manual submission
  - **D-006** Doc-only changes bump patch version because the skill description is the API surface
- **`assets/social-preview.png`** — 1200×630 PNG, the canonical social-card image (Twitter, GitHub, Slack, Discord unfurls). Distinct from `architecture.svg` — closed-loop ring on the right instead of the full 18-persona org chart.
- README now references the social preview underneath the architecture diagram.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **`assets/architecture.svg`** — a single 1440×820 SVG diagram showing the full closed loop:
  - Six numbered stages across the top: Issue → Plan → Implement → CI → Adversarial Review → Evidence Gate
  - Coordinator tying every stage together (no business code)
  - 18-persona agent org chart (2 rows × 8 boxes) color-coded by role (implement / review / queue / support)
  - Memory band at the bottom (project, architecture, role memories, lessons, ADRs, phase summaries)
  - Closed-loop curve returning to Issue ①
- **`## Discoverability` section in the README** explaining how `skills.sh` indexes the skill, with `npx skills find` commands users can run locally to verify inclusion.
- Diagram embedded at the very top of the README (right below the badges) so any visitor sees the architecture first.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **`## 使用指南 · Usage Guide`** section between the existing English content and the compatibility table. Bilingual (Chinese + English) and covers:
  - **4 highest-frequency invocations**: bootstrap from PRD / resume interrupted work / drive one Issue / audit or rescue
  - **7 operating principles** (evidence over vibes, cold-start review, L0–L3 context, Issue as unit, Worktree isolation, Human Approval Gate, memory as state)
  - **7 canonical prompt snippets** ready to copy
  - **Advanced usage** (30-second bootstrap, takeover of legacy repos, cross-CLI handoff, parallel Owners, CI self-recovery)
  - **Anti-patterns table** (7 ways to misuse the harness)
  - **When-(not)-to-use decision matrix**
  - **Maintenance commands** (`skills update`, post-commit hook for index refresh)
  - **Further reading** pointers to the rest of the repo
- README grew from 389 → 585 lines.
